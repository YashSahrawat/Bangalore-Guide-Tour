        <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p>The sanctuary, established on 14 January 1987 under Section 18 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1973, is spread over an area of 1,027.53 square kilometres (396.73 sq mi)[3] It lies in an elevation range of 125–1,514 metres (410–4,967 ft) (“Ponnachi Betta” is the highest mountain in the centre of the sanctuary[4]) with its northern and southern boundary delimited by the Cauvery River on the Eastern Ghats, which drains from west to east. Its eastern and northeastern borders are bounded by the Tamil Nadu state.[4][5] The river forms the interstate boundary between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states over a river reach of 73 kilometres (45 mi) with dense forests on both banks. The sanctuary is named after the Cauvery River which flows through it over a total length of 101 kilometres (63 mi).[4]

            Important places along the river stretch flowing through the sanctuary covering its forested central and eastern parts are the Hogenakal Falls (meaning: "smoking rock" in Kannada language), Mekedatu (meaning: "goats leap"), and Sangam (confluence with the Arkavathi River. An important religious centre within the sanctuary is Muthathi Anjaneya temple.[4] Also located within the sanctuary are an ecotourism fishing resort and the Cauvery Fishing Camp at Bhimeshwari.[6]
            
            The sanctuary is managed by the Deputy Conservator of Forests with four wildlife ranges at Kanakapura, Hanur, Cowdally and MM Hills wildlife ranges. The reserve forests, which are part of the sanctuary, are the Basavanabetta S.F (3,765.50 hectares (9,304.8 acres)), the Chilandavadi S.F (1,987.50 hectares (4,911.2 acres)), the Muggur S.F (2,044.00 hectares (5,050.8 acres)), the Chikkayalur S.F (13,875.00 hectares (34,285.9 acres)), and the Mahadeswara Reserve Forest (31,023.50 hectares (76,660.7 acres)).[4] The boundary of the sanctuary is well demarcated with the surrounding border areas consisting of agricultural lands and forests; the bordering forest areas are: the Kollegal forest division to its west and south, Mandya and Ramanagaram forest divisions to its north, and Dharmapuri Forest division of Tamil Nadu state to its east.[4]
            
            Human habitation inside the sanctuary and within 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) radius of the sanctuary consists of eight enclosed villages and 30 villages respectively with a total population of 39,000 whose main occupation is agriculture. Along the boundary of the sanctuary, a trench is excavated to prevent elephant migration to neighbouring villages and to check damage to agricultural lands.[</p>
        <h1>Activities in Dubare Elephant Camp</h1>
        <p>In Dubare elephant camp, tourists not only get to watch the elephants but get to interact with them as well. A trained naturalist explains the elephant’s history, biology and ecology. Tourists can also engage in bathing the elephants and feeding them in order to get an intimate experience with these animals in the presence of well-trained mahouts. Visitors can caress and closely interact with the elephants with the assigned mahouts or simply watch their activities from afar. Tourists can bathe the elephants, which gather around 9 AM by the river banks of Kaveri for their usual ritual of bathing for about 45 minutes. </p>
        
        <h1>Climate</h1>
        <p>The sanctuary has a semi-arid climate, where the average temperatures are a minimum of 5 °C (41 °F) and maximum of 38 °C (100 °F), and during summer it touches a maximum of 40 °C (104 °F). The sanctuary receives rainfall both during the Northeast monsoon and Southwest monsoon. The rainfall varies between 750 millimetres (30 in) and 800 millimetres (31 in).

  <p>Illegal mining around Bannerghatta national park
    The park is threatened by multiple granite quarries operating around the national park.[12] These quarries are located alarmingly close to critical elephant corridors inside the national park such as Kardikal - Madeswara corridor.[13] While there is ban on mining and granite quarrying around the national park within a radius of One km from the boundary demarcated as "Safe Zone", quarries operate unabatedly. Vehicular movement is also uncontrolled. Tremors from the explosives used in the quarry operations are felt across a radius of at least five km adversely affecting elephants and other wild animals.</p>
