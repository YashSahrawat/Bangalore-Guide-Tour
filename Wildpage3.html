  <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Bannerghatta National Park is a national park in India, located near Bangalore, Karnataka. It was founded in 1970 and declared as a national park in 1974.[1] In 2002, a small portion of the park became a zoological garden, the Bannerghatta Biological Park.</p>
    <P>There are ancient temples in the park for worship and it is a destination for trekking and hiking. Within the national park area are six rural villages enclosed within three large enclosures for sheep and cattle farming.[3] This park offers a wide range of diverse wildlife to the explorers. Coming from the finest of Bengaluru, Karnataka, this park offers a guided bus tour all along the 6 km safari roads, which is specially made for safaris and foreign tourist gatherers.

        Between 1995 and 2021, the dry deciduous forests in the National Park shrunk approximately by 44% due to uncontrolled diversion of forest land for agricultural purpose, urbanisation, etc[1]</P>

        <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p>The 65,127.5 acre (260.51 km2[4]) national park is located about 22 km south of Bangalore in the hills of the Anekal range with an elevation of 1245 - 1634m.[5] The park has a hilly terrain of granite sheets under moist deciduous forest valleys and scrubland on higher areas.[6] Sixteen villages border the park.

  <p>Illegal mining around Bannerghatta national park
    The park is threatened by multiple granite quarries operating around the national park.[12] These quarries are located alarmingly close to critical elephant corridors inside the national park such as Kardikal - Madeswara corridor.[13] While there is ban on mining and granite quarrying around the national park within a radius of One km from the boundary demarcated as "Safe Zone", quarries operate unabatedly. Vehicular movement is also uncontrolled. Tremors from the explosives used in the quarry operations are felt across a radius of at least five km adversely affecting elephants and other wild animals.</p>
