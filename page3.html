            <h1>Information</h1>
<p>Bangalore Palace is a 19th century royal palace located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, in an area that
     was owned by the Rev.
    John Garrett, the first principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now famous as Central College.
    The commencement of the construction of the palace is attributed to him.The palace belongs to Maharaja
     Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar and his wife Her Highness Pramoda Devi Wadiyar.</p>
      <h1>International Concerts</h1>
      <p> Many international artists have performed in the grounds. Today a legal battle between government
         and the Mysore royal family has seen a ban of commercial activities. Nevertheless, a number of 
         private companies controlled by the royal family runs a number of wedding halls on the grounds.
          For the past 34 years the oldest security agency of Karnataka named Scorpion Security Ltd has
           their national headquarters inside the palace premises.<br><br>

        Over the past few years, the palace grounds have been hosts to major music artists like: Iron 
        Maiden, Aerosmith, Backstreet Boys, Bryan Adams, Delirious?, Don Moen, Hillsong United, David 
        Guetta, Elton John, Deep Purple, Petra, Textures, Amon Amarth, Lamb of God, Mark Knopfler, Akon,
         The Black Eyed Peas, The Rolling Stones, Sepultura, Mr Big, Metallica, Megadeth, Michael Learns
          to Rock, Roger Waters, Guns N' Roses, The Prodigy, Dream Theater, No Doubt, Sepultura, Scorpions,
           Enrique Iglesias, Machine Head, Cradle of Filth, Jay Sean, Ludacris and Flo Rida.<br><br>
        
        Iron Maiden's performance in 2007 was a historic gig named Eddfest in the sub-continent. The 
        concert was part of the band's A Matter of Life and Death Tour. The name Eddfest is taken from 
        the band's mascot Eddie. The concert is the largest paid concert ever to take place in India with 
        an estimated 38,000 people in attendance with 4000 people watching from outside the venue without
         tickets. It marked the first visit of Iron Maiden to the Indian subcontinent, and the first major 
         heavy metal concert to take place in the country.<br><br>
        
        Jay Sean, Ludacris and Flo Rida performed in Palace Grounds on 22 September 2011 for the opening
         ceremony of the Champions League T20.<br><br>
        
        Metallica performed at the palace grounds on 30 October 2011 as part of the Rock N India festival,
         their first show in India which was attended by 31,000 people.[2] It would also turn out to be the
          last concert to take place as the state government and police stopped giving permission for any 
          future musical events or concerts at the venue (all concerts banned).</p><br>
